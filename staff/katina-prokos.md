#Katina Prokos

From North Miami Beach, Fla.

I'm a journalism major and business administration minor interested in pursuing a career in public relations/marketing. Most of my internships have been at museums, and I also have a background in performing arts as a graduate of New World School of the Arts high school in downtown Miami. I chose this capstone to get magazine production experience and practice my feature story writing with the hope that the skills I develop in this course broaden by job opportunities.
