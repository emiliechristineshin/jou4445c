# Week 4 starting January 28, 2014

Go through Week 3 goals. Write lots of comments on the story pitches. Flesh them out. You should spend several hours in there this week talking with your classmates to develop the pitches into stories. See what is possible. Suggest sources and multimedia. Share. Real work begins now.

## Preparation (before meeting)

1. [Update your group story](https://github.com/gotoplanb/jou4445c/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=open) with teammates, details from your meeting and success metrics.
2. [Pitch an individual story concept](https://github.com/gotoplanb/jou4445c/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=open) either within an existing topic (e.g. Coffee) or as a stand-alone.
3. Select an [additional role](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eFQaPRcuJP1gNwgBYKirmEdxfDqHKyl7mqVdeXrhsXY/viewform).
